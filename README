WARNING: This is only a prototype! If you feed it with big dumps, it might consume all your memory and never come to an end.

How to use the rulegen:
python rulegen.py dump

You can configure it via the rulegen.cfg.

You need dpkt [1], ipaddr [2] and python2.6 or greater, but not python3.x

You can feed it with dumps from any network-interface including pflog-dumps.
